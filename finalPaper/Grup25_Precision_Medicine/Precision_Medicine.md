## i. Predicting Treatment Response

After developing diagnostic and prognostic models from the previous step, there is a need of asssessing variables that define a novel taxonomy with their relevance in predicting treatment response. There are two strategies to develop models that predict treatment response.

- Prediction models can be developed based on the diagonostic and prognostic models from the previous stage as prognostic factors may act as the natural variables to consider when developing prediction models. For instance, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase status acts as a prognostic factor for survival in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer and a predictive factor for response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib as first-line treatment at the same time [Riley RD(will change later aftering sorting&numbering sources].

- The data can be directly utilized to extract significant information relevant to the prediction of the disease. For instance, in the first clinical trials that used the monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibody mepolizumab for asthma treatment, the use of mepolizumab was associated with a significant reductionin blood and sputum eosinophils, but did not have significant clinical benefit in asthma patients [Flood-Page]. Consequently, in the following trials, patients with refractory eosinophilic asthma were chose and in this subgroup, mepolizumab therapy added significant clinical benefit in patients by reducing exacerbations and improving asthma quality of life scores [Haldar P].
