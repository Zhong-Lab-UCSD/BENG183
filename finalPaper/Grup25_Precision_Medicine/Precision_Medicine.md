## i. Predicting Treatment Response

After developing diagnostic and prognostic models from the previous step, there is a need of asssessing variables that define a novel taxonomy with their relevance in predicting treatment response. There are two strategies to develop models that predict treatment response.

- Prediction models can be built on the diagnostic and prognostic models from the previous stage as prognostic factors may act as the natural variables to consider when developing prediction models. For instance, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase status acts as a prognostic factor for survival in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer and a predictive factor for response to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib as first-line treatment at the same time [Riley RD(will change later aftering sorting&numbering sources].

- The data can be directly utilized to extract significant information relevant to the prediction of the disease. For instance, in the first clinical trials that used the monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibody mepolizumab for asthma treatment, the use of mepolizumab was associated with a significant reductionin blood and sputum eosinophils, but did not have significant clinical benefit in asthma patients [Flood-Page]. Consequently, in the following trials, patients with refractory eosinophilic asthma were selected and in this subgroup, mepolizumab therapy added significant clinical benefit in patients by reducing exacerbations and improving asthma quality of life scores [Haldar P].

Below is an illustration of applying different treatment to categorized groups to increase efficiency of a treatment based on prection models.

This process of building prediction models involves generating further knowledge about the disease and treatment from the diagonotics and prognostics models or the data itself. The findings from this process, in the form of data, would be fed back to the phenotyping of patients to further adjusted for the clinical trial that could more precisely show the effectiveness of the treatment. 

In addition to the feedback, dissemination and communication of the taxonomy and models with the clinical and scientific communities, for instance, to provide utilizable algorithms for clinical practices.

## i+1. Evolving Precision Medicine

The figure below shows cycles of precision medicine and its subsequent outcome.

As seen in the figure, the cycle of patients assessment(deep phenotyping), data processing(preprocessing and data mining), and model building(diagonotic, prognostic, and prediction model building) is repeated at least several times to further increase the preciseness of the medicine by categorizing patient groups at higher resolution. 

The detailed steps are as follows:

1. In the first cycles, categorize patients into diagnostic/prognostic groups based on obvious charateristics.
2. In later cycles, define more specific groups of patients using more in-depth data that was obtained from the previous cycle as the data from each cycle is fed back to the next cycle of patient assessment. 
3. Eventually, this feedback loops may allow the final cycles to target individual patient with specific data profile.
